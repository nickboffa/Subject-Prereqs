# Subject-Prereqs
 Creating Graphs to Determine Prerequisite Courses for a Given Subject

I completed this project over the 2023 Winter Break, before I started using GitHub. I have retroactively added it now, especially as there is potential for more work to be done on it in the future. For example

- Make it so that URLs for each course's page are available when you click on it's 'button'
- Implement a search feature
- Design feature whereby you list all the subjects you've done, and the program shows you which majors/minors/specialisations/degrees you are closest to completing
